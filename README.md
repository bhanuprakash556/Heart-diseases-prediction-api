# Heart-diseases-prediction-api
In this machine learning project we built the API using the flask and machine learning algorithms to predict the heart diseases of the person
we use the heart diseases dataset downloaded from the github to train the algorithm and create the pickle of the algorithm to save the algorithm and use it in the heart diseases api
